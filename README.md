# Description of MNIST Dataset and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Study

Hello,

I would like to explain the study I conducted. The dataset I utilized is MNIST. MNIST is a dataset that consists of handwritten digits, with each image being a grayscale 28x28 pixel representation. It comprises a total of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples.

## Goal

My goal was to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recognize handwritten digits in these images. ANN is an algorithm type that simulates connections between neurons and layers. Networks of this kind can be highly successful in tasks like image classification.

## Training Process

As a first step, I trained the ANN using the MNIST dataset. During the training process, the network endeavored to learn to classify digits accurately in the images. After teaching the network using a portion of the training data, I used the remaining data to test it.

## Results

The results were quite successful. I achieved high accuracy rates in both the training data and the separated test data. This indicates that the developed ANN successfully recognizes handwritten digits.

## Conclusion

This study represents a significant step towards developing an artificial neural network model capable of handling and learning from image classification problems. If you have any further questions or would like more details on a specific topic, feel free to ask.

Best regards,
